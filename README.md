# Sand pile model
A basic python implementation of the [Bak–Tang–Wiesenfeld model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abelian_sandpile_model) with avalanche distribution plots, written as a test for my thesis. The power law distributions of avalanche durations and sizes results from the self-organized critical (SOC) behavior.

## Usage

To run the model, change the simulation parameters and run `run_single.py`.

The main model methods can be found at `sandpile.py`.

The avalanche plots and power law fits are done with on the [powerlaw](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/powerlaw) package.

Still to be properly documented...
